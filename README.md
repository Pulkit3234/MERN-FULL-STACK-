## Outcomes/Learning
This app is a full fledged social media type of app in which users can create, read, update and delete the posts with login/signup features. I learnt how to plan a big app like this before starting any new project this big. Then coming to the frontend side I leant about routing, redux store state management and how to access the global redux store state using the useSelector hooks and how to dispatch the actions to update the state with the help of useDispatch hook. On the backend side I learnt about the important CRUD functionality in the mongoDB database with the help of mongoose library.

## NPM Commands
